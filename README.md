# Horiseon-refactor
*Refactoring code for Horiseon Marketing front page*

## Description
This project starting with (mostly) operational code and tasked us with improving it with a focus on semantic HTML structures. Updates were provided to HTML tags as appropriate while also reoganizing and consolidating the CSS stylesheet. More information regarding the changes can be found in the commit messages.

The "hero" img (or background img) was moved from the CSS stylesheet to the HTML for searchability reasons. Unsure if this is a stock img or a real company photo but it displays more prominantly in search engines (which is what Horiseon is all about, right?) when used within the HTML.

Here's the Horiseon front page: (https://noheropage.github.io/Horiseon-refactor/)

Or just a peek-a-boo
